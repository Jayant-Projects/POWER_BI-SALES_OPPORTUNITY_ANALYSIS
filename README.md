SALES OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS

Situation:
In the context of a sales opportunity dashboard, my responsibility was to conduct a comprehensive sales analysis for a provided dataset. The initial challenge was to ensure the data's cleanliness and accuracy before proceeding to extract meaningful insights.

Task:
My task revolved around two main objectives. Firstly, I needed to cleanse the dataset by identifying and rectifying any anomalies or errors present.

I meticulously cleansed data, selected key metrics such as revenue growth and conversion rates, and employed visuals like bar and line graphs to showcase product performance and sales trends.

Result:
The data-driven approach revealed insights on top products, customer behavior, and untapped opportunities, aiding informed decisions.

Key Takeaways:
Proficiency in data cleansing, KPI selection, and impactful visualization for accurate sales analysis and opportunity identification.
